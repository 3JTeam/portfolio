      'This is a fantasy soccer league that pulls in real-world statistics from over 40 real leagues around the world. A user is then able to create a fantasy team based upon one of those leagues, choose players, set a lineup, and compete against other users. Built mainly in React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose schema, this full-stack program was my final project at Thinkful. This was my most challenging project to date as I had to not only design the layout but determine how the various pieces needed to interact with one another.',

      'A game where the program chooses a random number and the player tries to guess it in as few tries as possible. Although initially built as pure HTML, CSS, and JS, I refactored this when I started learning React and Redux. First, I created the necessary React components to control the view. Then, I used Redux to set up the flow of data through the app. This was the project that taught me the value of state and how to control it properly. Since this project, I have used React and Redux extensively to develop my front-ends elsewhere.',
