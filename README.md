# portfolio

I rebuilt my portfolio site with Vue and Vuex as these are my preferred front-end frameworks, as compared to React/Redux. I also built it so that I can more easily keep it updated by adding or subtracting info in the different data files (ie. projectData.js). Further, I cleaned up the overall look and went with a more minimalist design as compared to what I had before, and ensured a responsive mobile-first web design to accomodate various screen sizes.
